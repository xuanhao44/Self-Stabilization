# 7 Local Stabilization

Locality is a desired property of self-stabilizing algorithms. The motivation is to avoid situations in which a small number of transient faults cause an entire system to start a global convergence activity in which the system behaves in an unspecified and undesired way. The terms superstabilizing, fault containment, time-adaptive, and local stabilization are used to describe an algorithm that converges to a safe configuration in a graceful way following the occurrence of a limited number of faults.

局部性是自稳定算法所期望的特性。其动机是为了避免由于少量瞬态故障引起整个系统启动全局收敛活动，在此过程中系统表现出未指定和不期望的行为。超稳定性、故障封闭、时间自适应和局部稳定性这些术语被用来描述在发生有限数量的故障后优雅地收敛到安全配置的算法。
