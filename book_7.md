# 7 Local Stabilization

Locality is a desired property of self-stabilizing algorithms. The motivation is to avoid situations in which a small number of transient faults cause an entire system to start a global convergence activity in which the system behaves in an unspecified and undesired way. The terms superstabilizing, fault containment, time-adaptive, and local stabilization are used to describe an algorithm that converges to a safe configuration in a graceful way following the occurrence of a limited number of faults.
