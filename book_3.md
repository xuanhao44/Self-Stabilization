# 3 Motivating Self-Stabilization

Now that we have some intuition about self-stabilization, it is time for additional motivation. We first examine a basic communication task â€” that of the data-link layer in the OSI layer model [Tan96]. As we show next, it turns out that there is no reliable data-link algorithm that can withstand processor crashes. We then extend the above result to show that crashes may cause the system to reach an arbitrary state.
