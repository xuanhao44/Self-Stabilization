# 3 Motivating Self-Stabilization

Now that we have some intuition about self-stabilization, it is time for additional motivation. We first examine a basic communication task — that of the data-link layer in the OSI layer model [Tan96]. As we show next, it turns out that there is no reliable data-link algorithm that can withstand processor crashes. We then extend the above result to show that crashes may cause the system to reach an arbitrary state.

现在我们对自稳定性有了一些直觉，是时候进行额外的动机分析了。我们首先检查一个基本的通信任务 —— OSI 层模型中的数据链路层 [Tan96]。正如我们接下来所展示的，事实证明，没有可靠的数据链路算法能够承受处理器崩溃。然后我们扩展上述结果，表明崩溃可能导致系统达到任意状态。
